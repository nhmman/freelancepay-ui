## What is FreelancePay?

FreelancePay is an AI Payment Agent that automates escrow and milestone payouts for freelancers — built natively on Arc Testnet using Circle Developer Wallets and USDC-native settlement.

**The problem:** Vietnam has 2M+ freelancers facing PayPal freezes, 20% Upwork fees, and no trusted escrow for international clients.

**The solution:** Trustless USDC escrow, instant payouts, and on-chain reputation — no middlemen.

### Reputation scoring status

Reputation scoring is **simulated** in the current build. `app/api/reputation/route.ts`
returns scores from a hardcoded map (`15994 → 95`, `1 → 30`, `100 → 65`) and falls back
to a random value for any other agent ID. It does not read an on-chain reputation
registry, and `app/api/reputation/pay/route.ts` does not write a score anywhere — it
only transfers USDC at the bonus-adjusted amount.

The score-based payout tiers themselves are real: the bonus is computed and the USDC
transfer executes on Arc Testnet. Only the *source* of the score is stubbed, pending a
registry to read from.

## Circle Product Feedback

**Why we chose these products:**
- **Circle Developer Wallets** — perfect for AI agent payments where users don't need to manage private keys
- **Arc App Kit** — simplified Send/Swap/Bridge into single SDK calls, reduced code by 60%
- **USDC on Arc** — instant settlement with predictable fees, ideal for freelancer payouts

**What worked well:**
- App Kit's `kit.send()` replaced 30+ lines of manual Circle API calls
- Circle Wallets adapter worked seamlessly with Arc Testnet
- CCTP Bridge across Base Sepolia → Arc worked reliably

**What could be improved:**
- App Kit needs better error messages for insufficient balance cases
- Circle Wallets adapter documentation for Arc-specific setup could be clearer
- Would love a webhook system for payment confirmation events
